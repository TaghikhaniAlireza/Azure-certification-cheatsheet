# 🔐 SC-900: Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals

This repository will host my personal notes and cheat sheets for the **SC-900 certification**, focused on foundational knowledge in Microsoft security, compliance, and identity (SCI).

> 🚀 This is part of my broader learning journey in Azure Security. I’m documenting my progress publicly to support others and build a personal knowledge base — especially for Farsi-speaking learners.
