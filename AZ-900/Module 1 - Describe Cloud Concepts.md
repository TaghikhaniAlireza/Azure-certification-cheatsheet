# Module 1: Describe Cloud Concepts

## Introduction to Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services to help you build solutions to meet your business goals.

## Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet.  
Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking.

Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## Describe the Shared Responsibility Model

With the shared responsibility model, responsibilities are shared between the cloud provider and the consumer.

**You (the consumer) are always responsible for:**
- The information and data stored in the cloud  
- Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, etc.)  
- The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

**The cloud provider is always responsible for:**
- The physical datacenter  
- The physical network  
- The physical hosts

## Define Cloud Models

### Private Cloud
A private cloud may be hosted from your on-site datacenter. It may also be hosted in a dedicated datacenter offsite, potentially even by a third party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company.

### Public Cloud
A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. Anyone can access and use resources. The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.

### Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an interconnected environment.

### Multi-cloud
In a multi-cloud environment, you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

### Azure Arc
Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment.

### Azure VMware Solution
Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.

## Describe the Consumption-Based Model

- **CapEx** is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources.  
- **OpEx** is spending money on services or products over time.  
- In a cloud-based model, you don’t have to worry about getting the resource needs just right.  
- Cloud computing uses a **pay-as-you-go pricing model**.  
- It's essentially renting compute power and storage from someone else’s datacenter.  
- Instead of maintaining CPUs and storage in your datacenter, you rent them for the time that you need them.

# Describe the Benefits of Using Cloud Services

## High Availability and Scalability

- Uptime (availability) and the ability to handle demand (scalability) are critical.
- **Scalability** means adjusting resources to meet demand.
- Benefit: You don't overpay for unused services.

**Types of scalability:**
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources.  
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding or subtracting the number of resources.

---

## Reliability and Predictability

- **Reliability**: System's ability to recover from failure and continue functioning. It's a pillar of Azure’s Well-Architected Framework.
- **Predictability**: Can refer to performance or cost.

**Performance Predictability:**
- Autoscaling  
- Load balancing  
- High availability  

**Cost Predictability:**
- Tools like **TCO** or **Pricing Calculator** help forecast costs.

---

## Security and Governance

- Templates help ensure that deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulations.

---

## Manageability

**Two types:**

### 1. Management *of* the cloud
- Automatically scale resources based on need  
- Deploy resources using templates  
- Monitor and auto-replace failing resources  
- Set alerts on metrics for real-time awareness

### 2. Management *in* the cloud
- Web portal  
- Command Line Interface (CLI)  
- APIs  
- PowerShell

# Describe Cloud Service Types

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Most flexible category; gives maximum control.

**Common scenarios:**
- **Lift-and-shift migration**: Move on-prem workloads to cloud  
- **Testing & Development**: Replicate and manage environments quickly

---

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Middle ground between IaaS and SaaS.

**Benefits:**
- No need to manage OS/database licensing or patching.

**Common scenarios:**
- **Development framework**: Build apps with built-in software components.  
- **Analytics/BI**: Analyze data to gain insights and improve decision-making.

---

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

Fully developed application ready to use. Least flexible, most user-friendly.

**Common scenarios:**
- Email and messaging  
- Business productivity apps  
- Finance and expense tracking
