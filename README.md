# Azure Cloud Study Notes

So, I’ve been diving into various **Azure certification** courses (all based on the official materials from Microsoft), and I thought it would be a good idea to share my study notes with others. These notes cover everything from **basic cloud concepts** to more advanced **Azure services** and **security/compliance** topics.

The goal here is to provide a structured study guide that will help anyone preparing for Azure exams. As I go through more courses, I’ll keep adding my notes here so that this becomes a more complete resource.

## What’s included so far?

### AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
- **Module 1**: Describe Cloud Concepts
- **Module 2**: Describe Azure Architecture and Services
- **Module 3**: Describe Azure Management and Governance

### SC-900: Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals
- **Module 1**: Describe the Concepts of Security, Compliance, and Identity
- **Module 2**: Describe the Capabilities of Microsoft Entra
- **Module 3**: Describe the Capabilities of Microsoft Security Solutions
- **Module 4**: Describe the Capabilities of Microsoft Priva and Microsoft Purview

As I continue studying more Azure topics, I’ll keep adding them here!
