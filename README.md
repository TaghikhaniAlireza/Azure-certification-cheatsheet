# Azure Cloud Study Notes

So, I’ve been diving into various **Azure certification** courses (all based on the official materials from Microsoft), and I thought it would be a good idea to share my study notes with others. These notes cover everything from **basic cloud concepts** to more advanced **Azure services** and **security/compliance** topics.

The goal here is to provide a structured study guide that will help anyone preparing for Azure exams. As I go through more courses, I’ll keep adding my notes here so that this becomes a more complete resource.
